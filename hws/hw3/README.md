Homework 3: Improving the machine learning pipeline
---
Aya Liu 5/2/2019

To refine the machine learning pipeline to allow for:
- building a number of models with different parameters
- temporal validation
- computing and visualizing evaluation metrics at k% population

Code
---
Code for the machine learning pipeline is in `pipeline.py`.
The pipeline is fully run in `hw3-pipeline-notebook.ipynb`.

Report
---
See [hw3-report.pdf](https://github.com/aya-liu/machine-learning-for-policy/blob/master/hws/hw3/hw3-report.pdf)

Dependencies
---
Set up virtual environment with venv
`python3 -m venv venv`
`source ./venv/bin/activate`

Install packages specified in requirements.txt
`pip -r install requirements.txt`
